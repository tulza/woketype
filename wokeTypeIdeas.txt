[mods]
#fun:

sudden death(any) - player dies upon typing the wrong character
full flip(ex.m:flip) - the entire type area is flipped 180degs

#difficulty increasing:

hidden - hide current letter and approaching letters base on current type speed
flip(m:fullflip) - letter flips upside down
flashlight - put a dark overlay  
shake(any) - shake the letters 
randomise(ex.g:cyr m:hidden) - the words are randomised until close
blurry(ex.m:hidden) - upcoming words are all blurry
rotate(any) - while typing the website snap rotates a little every letter
scatter(any) - the letters are scattered a little from the position and rotated as well
mouse type(any) - disable keyboard and type with mouse via keyboard overlay on normal test type


[other game idea gimmicks]

reaction type test:
normal reaction test but you type out the word,
words are given to you at the beginning so the player always know what is coming up.
